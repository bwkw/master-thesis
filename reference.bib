  abstract = "Using molecular dynamics simulations and the Green–Kubo method, the thermal transport in the Lennard-Jones argon face centered cubic crystal is described by two time constants related to the decay of the heat current autocorrelation function. The first time scale is associated with short wavelength acoustic phonons that have mean free paths equal to one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is independent of temperature, and has a value around 0.09 W/mK. The second time scale is longer, and corresponds to acoustic phonons with mean free paths longer than one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is temperature dependent, and ranges from 3.92 W/mK at a temperature of 10 K to 0.08 W/mK at a temperature of 100 K. This decomposition allows for a comparison of the crystal phase results with those from corresponding amorphous and liquid phases."

By fitting selected experimental values of B(T) and using up to three different plausible quadrupole moments of the molecules, we have determined site-site Lennard-Jones parameters for N2, O2, H2, CO and CO2. We have also considered, in addition to electrostatic interactions, a limited spherical harmonics expansion of the site-site potential. By using at short range only the isotropic part of this expansion, we have derived parameters that are close for N2, O2 and H2 to the exact site-site parameters. The validity of this approximation in the truncated site-site potential is more questionable for CO and CO2."

  abstract = "This work describes the SIMD vectorization of the force calculation of the Lennard-Jones potential with Intel AVX2 and AVX-512 instruction sets. Since the force-calculation kernel of the molecular dynamics method involves indirect access to memory, the data layout is one of the most important factors in vectorization. We find that the Array of Structures (AoS) with padding exhibits better performance than Structure of Arrays (SoA) with appropriate vectorization and optimizations. In particular, AoS with 512-bit width exhibits the best performance among the architectures. While the difference in performance between AoS and SoA is significant for the vectorization with AVX2, that with AVX-512 is minor. The effect of other optimization techniques, such as software pipelining together with vectorization, is also discussed. We present results for benchmarks on three CPU architectures: Intel Haswell (HSW), Knights Landing (KNL), and Skylake (SKL). The performance gains by vectorization are about 42% on HSW compared with the code optimized without vectorization. On KNL, the hand-vectorized codes exhibit 34% better performance than the codes vectorized automatically by the Intel compiler. On SKL, the code vectorized with AVX2 exhibits slightly better performance than that with vectorized AVX-512."

  abstract = {Abstract The technique proposed here for the evaluation of azeotrope lines by molecular simulation builds on ideas used to devise the Gibbs-Duhem integration (GDI) technique for evaluating phase equilibria by molecular simulation. Beginning with a known azeotropic state point, the method integrates a differential equation for the locus of azeotropes with a single semigrand-ensemble molecular simulation performed at each integration state point. Unlike the standard GDI method, fluctuation quantities are needed to conduct the integration. Although these quantities are measured less precisely than simple ensemble averages, the integration is not adversely affected by this difficulty. The method is demonstrated by applying to three model Lennard-Jones binaries. Among these mixtures is one in which the molecular diameter of one species is varied along the azeotrope line. This application shows how details of the intermolecular interactions affect azeotropic behavior. Such an understanding might be useful in formulating additives to break an azeotrope.},
