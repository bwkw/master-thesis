  abstract = {This work describes an implementation of canonical and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs). The pair-wise energy calculations, which consume the majority of the computational effort, are parallelized using the energetic decomposition algorithm. While energetic decomposition is relatively inefficient for traditional CPU-bound codes, the algorithm is ideally suited to the architecture of the GPU. The performance of the CPU and GPU codes are assessed for a variety of CPU and GPU combinations for systems containing between 512 and 131,072 particles. For a system of 131,072 particles, the GPU-enabled canonical and Gibbs ensemble codes were 10.3 and 29.1 times faster (GTX 480 GPU vs. i5-2500K CPU), respectively, than an optimized serial CPU-bound code. Due to overhead from memory transfers from system RAM to the GPU, the CPU code was slightly faster than the GPU code for simulations containing less than 600 particles. The critical temperature Tc∗=1.312(2) and density ρc∗=0.316(3) were determined for the tail corrected Lennard-Jones potential from simulations of 10,000 particle systems, and found to be in exact agreement with prior mixed field finite-size scaling calculations [J.J.

The first time scale is associated with short wavelength acoustic phonons that have mean free paths equal to one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is independent of temperature, and has a value around 0.09 W/mK. The second time scale is longer, and corresponds to acoustic phonons with mean free paths longer than one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is temperature dependent, and ranges from 3.92 W/mK at a temperature of 10 K to 0.08 W/mK at a temperature of 100 K. This decomposition allows for a comparison of the crystal phase results with those from corresponding amorphous and liquid phases."

By fitting selected experimental values of B(T) and using up to three different plausible quadrupole moments of the molecules, we have determined site-site Lennard-Jones parameters for N2, O2, H2, CO and CO2. We have also considered, in addition to electrostatic interactions, a limited spherical harmonics expansion of the site-site potential. By using at short range only the isotropic part of this expansion, we have derived parameters that are close for N2, O2 and H2 to the exact site-site parameters. The validity of this approximation in the truncated site-site potential is more questionable for CO and CO2."

Since the force-calculation kernel of the molecular dynamics method involves indirect access to memory, the data layout is one of the most important factors in vectorization. We find that the Array of Structures (AoS) with padding exhibits better performance than Structure of Arrays (SoA) with appropriate vectorization and optimizations. In particular, AoS with 512-bit width exhibits the best performance among the architectures. While the difference in performance between AoS and SoA is significant for the vectorization with AVX2, that with AVX-512 is minor. The effect of other optimization techniques, such as software pipelining together with vectorization, is also discussed. We present results for benchmarks on three CPU architectures: Intel Haswell (HSW), Knights Landing (KNL), and Skylake (SKL). The performance gains by vectorization are about 42% on HSW compared with the code optimized without vectorization. On KNL, the hand-vectorized codes exhibit 34% better performance than the codes vectorized automatically by the Intel compiler. On SKL, the code vectorized with AVX2 exhibits slightly better performance than that with vectorized AVX-512."

This paper shows how these tools can be used for optimal design of complex azeotropic distillation columns. Two examples of the design of distillation systems of industrial importance are shown. In the first example, the second feed location of a two-feed distillation column with a top decanter is optimized. In the second example, the side stream draw-stage location of a distillation column with a top decanter and a side stream draw is optimized. In both cases, a feasible and near optimal structure has been designed based on information obtained by examining the whole composition space.}

  abstract = {Extractive distillation processes enable the separation of non-ideal mixtures, including minimum or maximum boiling azeotropes and low relative volatility mixtures. Unlike azeotropic distillation, the entrainer fed at another location than the main mixture induces an extractive section within the column. A general feasibility criterion shows that intermediate and light entrainers and heterogeneous entrainers are suitable along common heavy entrainers. Entrainer selection rules rely upon selectivity ratios and residue curve map (rcm) topology including univolatility curves. For each type of entrainer, we define extractive separation classes that summarize feasibility regions, achievable products and entrainer – feed flow rate ratio limits. Case studies are listed as Supplementary materials. Depending on the separation class, a direct or an indirect split column configuration will allow to obtain a distillate product or a bottom product, which is usually a saddle point of rcm. Batch and continuous process operations differ mainly by the feasible ranges for the entrainer – feed flow rate ratio and reflux ratio. The batch process is feasible under total reflux and can orient the still path by changing the reflux policy. Optimisation of the extractive process must systematically consider the extractive column along with the entrainer regeneration column that requires energy and may limit the product purity in the extractive column through recycle. For the sake of reducing the energy cost and the total cost, pressure change can be beneficial as it affects volatility, or new process structures can be devised, namely heat integrated extractive distillation, extractive divided wall column or processes with preconcentrator.}

  abstract = {Synthesis of methyl palmitate (MP) has not been considered in the past using a reactive distillation process (continuous or batch) due to the challenge of keeping the reactants palmitic acid (PA) and methanol (MeOH) together in the reactive zone. MeOH, being the lightest in the reaction mixture, travels up the distillation column as distillation proceeds and will be removed from the system via the distillate in a conventional batch reactive distillation (CBRD) column and thus will limit the conversion of PA. Therefore, in this work semi-batch reactive distillation (SBRD) column is proposed where additional methanol will be fed at the bottom of the column in a continuous mode allowing the chemical reaction to continue. However, as water (H2O) is one of the reaction products and is the second lightest component in the mixture, it will travel up the column next and will be removed in the distillate tank. Also due to wide difference in the boiling points of the reaction products and due to diminishing amount of water in the reboiler, the backward reaction will not be a dominating factor and therefore ignored in this work. With this backdrop, optimal performance of the SBRD column is evaluated in terms of conversion of PA to MP and energy consumption via minimization of the operating batch time for a wide range on MP purity.}

  abstract = {Abstract The technique proposed here for the evaluation of azeotrope lines by molecular simulation builds on ideas used to devise the Gibbs-Duhem integration (GDI) technique for evaluating phase equilibria by molecular simulation. Beginning with a known azeotropic state point, the method integrates a differential equation for the locus of azeotropes with a single semigrand-ensemble molecular simulation performed at each integration state point. Unlike the standard GDI method, fluctuation quantities are needed to conduct the integration. Although these quantities are measured less precisely than simple ensemble averages, the integration is not adversely affected by this difficulty. The method is demonstrated by applying to three model Lennard-Jones binaries. Among these mixtures is one in which the molecular diameter of one species is varied along the azeotrope line. This application shows how details of the intermolecular interactions affect azeotropic behavior. Such an understanding might be useful in formulating additives to break an azeotrope.},
