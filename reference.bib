    abstract = "Using molecular dynamics simulations and the Green–Kubo method, the thermal transport in the Lennard-Jones argon face centered cubic crystal is described by two time constants related to the decay of the heat current autocorrelation function. The first time scale is associated with short wavelength acoustic phonons that have mean free paths equal to one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is independent of temperature, and has a value around 0.09 W/mK. The second time scale is longer, and corresponds to acoustic phonons with mean free paths longer than one half of their wavelength. The associated thermal conductivity is temperature dependent, and ranges from 3.92 W/mK at a temperature of 10 K to 0.08 W/mK at a temperature of 100 K. This decomposition allows for a comparison of the crystal phase results with those from corresponding amorphous and liquid phases."

By fitting selected experimental values of B(T) and using up to three different plausible quadrupole moments of the molecules, we have determined site-site Lennard-Jones parameters for N2, O2, H2, CO and CO2. We have also considered, in addition to electrostatic interactions, a limited spherical harmonics expansion of the site-site potential. By using at short range only the isotropic part of this expansion, we have derived parameters that are close for N2, O2 and H2 to the exact site-site parameters. The validity of this approximation in the truncated site-site potential is more questionable for CO and CO2."

    abstract = {Abstract The technique proposed here for the evaluation of azeotrope lines by molecular simulation builds on ideas used to devise the Gibbs-Duhem integration (GDI) technique for evaluating phase equilibria by molecular simulation. Beginning with a known azeotropic state point, the method integrates a differential equation for the locus of azeotropes with a single semigrand-ensemble molecular simulation performed at each integration state point. Unlike the standard GDI method, fluctuation quantities are needed to conduct the integration. Although these quantities are measured less precisely than simple ensemble averages, the integration is not adversely affected by this difficulty. The method is demonstrated by applying to three model Lennard-Jones binaries. Among these mixtures is one in which the molecular diameter of one species is varied along the azeotrope line. This application shows how details of the intermolecular interactions affect azeotropic behavior. Such an understanding might be useful in formulating additives to break an azeotrope.},
